# I'm Simone,

a Software Engineering Student at [42 Berlin](https://42berlin.de)

## Project I'm most proud of:

[Minishell](https://github.com/simone-gasparini-94/minishell): a custom shell built in C.

Besides making me more confident with C and systems programming, this project taught me how to collaborate and work in a team on a technical project.

## My interests are:

I'm enjoying working with APIs. My [Weather App](https://github.com/simone-gasparini-94/weather-app) was my first project about fetching and displaying data.

Now, I'm excited to dive into backend development, learning how to process and cache data.

## My skillset is:
