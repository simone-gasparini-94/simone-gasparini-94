Software Engineering Student @ [42 Berlin](https://42berlin.de)

## Project I'm most proud of:

[Minishell](https://github.com/simone-gasparini-94/minishell): a custom shell built in C.

My first project on this topic is a [Weather App](https://github.com/simone-gasparini-94/weather-app), which I'm still working on.

As a next step, I would like to learn how to build a backend that processes and caches data.

## My skills are:
