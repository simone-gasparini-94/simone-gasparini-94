# Simone Gasparini

Software Engineering Student @ [42 Berlin](https://42berlin.de)

## Project that I'm most proud of:

[Minishell](https://github.com/simone-gasparini-94/minishell): Custom shell built in C as the first group project of the 42 Curriculum

## Interests:

Currently having fun experimenting how to fetch and display data from public APIs.

My first project on the subject is a [Weather App](https://github.com/simone-gasparini-94/weather-app), which I'm currently working on.

As a next step, I would like to learn how to build a backend that processes and caches data.
